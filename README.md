# CheckScan

##Overview
CheckScan is a prototype that enables users to upload images of bank checks whether singular or in a batch and extracts important information (ex. bank name, amount, currency) into a CSV. This prototype is a part of my bachelor project to digitally transform an internal organizational process.
